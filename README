== Rails 3.1 upgraded version of James Yu's CloudEdit(https://github.com/jamesyu/CloudEdit).

To make easier to try the James Yu example, I upgraded it to Rails 3.1.
The excellent tutorial by James Yu (http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/) explains how to use Rails and backbone.js together.

== Main changes for upgrade
- Use rails3.1 assets instead of jammit
- Upgraded Backbone 0.5.3 and changed Backbone.Controller to Backbone.Router
- Change jammit micro-template to EJS gem(https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-ejs)

== To run
- bundle install
- rake db:migrate
- rails s
